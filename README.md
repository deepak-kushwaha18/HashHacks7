# Breif

CodeBuzz is a real-time collaboration platform built for developers who love building things together. The idea is simple — you start a project, invite your teammates, and you’re all set to code, chat, and brainstorm in one place.
Ran into an issue? Just drop your code snippet in the project chat — your collaborators can check it out and help, or even better, our AI can jump in and suggest fixes or improvements. It’s like pair programming, but smarter and smoother.
Whether you're debugging something small or building a full app, CodeBuzz makes teamwork feel less like work. No more switching between ten tools — it’s all here: chat, code, AI, and real people, working together in real time.
